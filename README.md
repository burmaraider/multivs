# Multi VS. Game Boards


## Description

This board design will allow you to run up to 8 games per side on a Nintendo Vs. board. Larger games like wrecking crew will limit the amount of games you can have on this.

## Whats included

This repo includes the following:
- GERBER Files needed to send to a fab house
- Eagle CAD files so that you can modify this design further, and/or fix things. (both 7.x and 9.x files)
- **Parts list** - coming soon
- **An application to package up ROM's so that you can burn to some flash memory** - coming soon


## Why do this?

Things should be free in this world. And if you don't agree, well, okay then.

## Final note

If you like this, please share and spread the love. If you have fixed anything, please share and upload back here.
